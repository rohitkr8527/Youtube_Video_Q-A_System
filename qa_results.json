      "question": "Explain RAG in breif",
      "answer": "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a solution pattern that combines a large language model (LLM) with a retrieval system to generate answers to user questions. The retrieval system finds relevant content related to the question, and the LLM uses that content to generate a more accurate and informative response."

      "question": "How does RAG works",
      "answer": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a solution pattern used to leverage large language models (LLMs) with your own content. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Content Chunking**: The content is broken down into smaller chunks, such as paragraphs or pages.\n2. **Vectorization**: Each chunk is sent to an LLM, which converts it into a vector (a series of numbers) that represents the essence of the chunk. Similar chunks on similar topics will have similar vectors.\n3. **Question Vectorization**: When a user asks a question, it is also sent to the LLM, which converts it into a vector (the question vector).\n4. **Comparison**: The question vector is compared mathematically to the vectors of the content chunks to find the top matching chunks (typically the top 5).\n5. **Retrieval**: The top matching chunks are retrieved and used to augment the LLM's generation process.\n6. **Generation**: The LLM uses the retrieved chunks to generate a response to the user's question.\n\nThe goal of RAG is to provide a more accurate and relevant response by leveraging the user's own content and using the LLM to generate a response based on the most relevant information. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of content and complex topics."
